Project Outline: Battleship Gave over the Network

Core Topics Integration Dynamic Memory Management: Efficiently handle memory allocation for game states, boards, and network buffers. Process/Threads Handling: Implement multi-threading for game handling to enable simultaneous player actions. Concurrency: Ensure thread safety while managing game data shared between players. Networking: Use sockets to establish a networked connection between players, enabling them to play the game remotely. Inter-Procedure Calls: Implement modular functions for game logic, networking, and input handling to promote clean code architecture.

Game Features Two-Player Network Game: The game should allow two players to connect and play over a local network or the internet. Game Board Representation: Use a 2D array to represent player boards. Move Handling: Implement a system for players to enter moves, with validation to check for valid attacks. Win Detection: Include logic to determine when a player has won (all ships of the opponent are hit). Synchronization: Ensure that moves are properly synchronized between the two players to prevent race conditions.

Networking Details Client-Server Model: Server: Handles connections from multiple clients and acts as the game host. Client: Connects to the server to participate in the game. Communication Protocol: Design a simple text-based protocol to communicate moves and game states (e.g., sending and receiving coordinates). Socket Programming: Use TCP sockets for reliable communication between the client and server.

Concurrency and Multi-Threading Server Threads: Each client connection runs in a separate thread to handle concurrent gameplay. Mutexes: Protect shared resources (e.g., game state) to avoid data corruption.

Memory Management Static Allocation: to manage memory for game data, including player boards and move histories. Error Checking: Ensure proper error handling when allocating or deallocating memory to avoid leaks.

Implementation Strategy Phase 1: Core Game Logic Create a single-player version for testing game mechanics. Phase 2: Networking Integration Develop server-client communication using sockets. Phase 3: Concurrency and Threading Add threading to handle multiple clients and game synchronization. Phase 4: Testing and Debugging Perform comprehensive testing, including edge cases and network stability.
